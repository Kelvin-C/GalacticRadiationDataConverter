# Printing 3D Model of Galactic Radiation

Galactic radiation recorded by satellites, including Planck satellite, are converted into positions in 3D Cartesian coordinates. The data were scaled with various mathematical functions to allow the best 3D model to be printed.
The output file is in .xyz, containing the coordinates of each data point.

The data can be downloaded from http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/#home
